# NixOS 23.11 Channel Xorg AwesomeWM Config
This channel contains a NixOS 23.11 Channel based configured for an X11/AwesomeWM system.
This is a messy and deprecated system configuration with a bunch of imperative implementations.
I keep it only for reference.

Use the nixos-flake AwesomeWM specialisation instead for a better version of this config.
